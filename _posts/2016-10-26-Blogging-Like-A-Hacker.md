I found myself in the middle of 20s and have no idea what to do for the rest of my life. Therefore, I decide to start my blog and explore the world from four major perspectives: `Algorithms`, `Full stack development`, `Finance` and `Data analysis`.

I hope I can force myself update my learning into this blog day by day.
